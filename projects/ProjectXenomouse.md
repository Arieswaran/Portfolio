Welcome to Project: Xenomouse, the game where you get to play scientist and raise the perfect mutant mouse to save the world!

First, you'll need to RAISE your xenomouse and make sure it reaches its full potential. Don't forget to feed it, brush it, and play with it – because even mutant mice need some TLC.

Then comes the fun part – testing your xenomouse's abilities by RUNNING it through a maze.

Watch out for the catamanders (whatever those are), collect some cheese along the way, and try not to let your xenomouse die.

But if it does, no worries – just use its carcass to improve your next xenomouse. It's like recycling, but for mutant mice!

Once your xenomouse successfully completes the maze, you'll have undeniable scientific evidence of its potential to save the world. Don't question how, just trust us.

So come on, let's have some fun and toy with the sanctity of life! Who said science can't be hilarious?
