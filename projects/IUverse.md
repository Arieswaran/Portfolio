summary: "A simple picture puzzle game"
---

IUverse is a fun and engaging Android game that I developed as a personal project. It is a picture puzzle game that offers endless levels and increasing difficulty as the user progresses through the game. As a player completes each level, they unlock a new picture that is added to their gallery, creating a sense of achievement and progress.

The game's mechanics are simple, yet challenging enough to keep the player engaged. The user is presented with a jumbled picture that they need to rearrange in order to create the original image.

One of the key features of IUverse is the infinite number of levels. This ensures that the user never runs out of puzzles to solve and that they can continue to play for as long as they want. After a certain number of levels, the game will begin to repeat the puzzles, but with less time to complete them. This increases the difficulty and provides a new challenge for the user.

IUverse's design is simple, making it easy for users of all ages and skill levels to play. The gallery feature, which unlocks new pictures as the user progresses, provides a sense of accomplishment and creates a feeling of ownership over their progress in the game.

While IUverse is not my best game, it holds a special place in my portfolio as it was my first fully completed personal project. It was an opportunity for me to learn about game development and hone my skills in programming and design. The game was launched on the Google Play Store, allowing me to share my creation with a wider audience and receive valuable feedback.

In conclusion, IUverse is a simple yet engaging Android game that offers endless levels and increasing difficulty as the player progresses. Its intuitive design and gallery feature provide a sense of accomplishment and ownership over progress. It is a testament to my skills in programming and design, and serves as a stepping stone in my journey as a game developer.
